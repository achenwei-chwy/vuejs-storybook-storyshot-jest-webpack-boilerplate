# vuejs-storybook-storyshot-jest-webpack-boilerplate
Boilerplate for someone wants a clean start at any point for building a VueJS web application in combine with storybook, storyshot, jest, webpakc, and other accessories that may come later!

# Q: Why another Vue boilerplate?
Initially, I chose (presumably) the easiest way to start - start the Vue setup from vue-cli3 the shinning armor for basic Vue configuration! Ends up, I encountered LOAD of issue trying to setup the exact samething that I personally hand configured for React with Storybook, Storyshot, and Jest, because overhead I have to learn about vue-cli and how it work, and why things break... I know that I needed a ..better way... a clearer path ... a new begining ... to learn! Yes, start from stratch! Clearly, vue-cli is not made for fine configuration, at least not yet at this day (10/26/2018), things can change, you never know!

# Q: How can it help Me? All the stuff are already setup, now I got all these mess I dont understand any way :(
Good point! That's the branches in this repo are for! Look into the branches, you will see something like `step/xxxx` within each `step` branch, there are commits that document the change and referencing articles, github issues and etc that I took my work and learned from. So you can learn from it too and start from whichever step you'd like to learn from! Freedom!

# Q: How can I start play with the app?

`npm run setup` for initial install and reinstall with clean up

`npm run storybook` for running our storybook

`npm run test` for running jest test with snapshot generation with storshot!

`npm run dev` start developing

`npm run build` build the final dist

# Q: Whats next?
Open issues and contribute! That's what Open Source about! Have fun and contribute! Enjoy!
